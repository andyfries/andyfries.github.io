title: About
---

I'm Andy Fries, a software engineer passionate about building high-quality software and teams. I spent most of the last decade at Amazon, solving problems from studio asset management (with some truly massive S3 buckets) to serving music requests on Alexa and many more in between. More recently I've applied those skills for the social good at ParentCubby, a pre-seed startup working to better connect parents and kids through technology. Nowadays I'm at Airbnb working as a fullstack engineer on the frontpage of the guest experience. 

As a senior engineering leader, I've found my niche in the intersection of people and technology. I take a holistic view of delivering software, and I've learned that the best quality solutions most enjoyed by users tend to be built by teams of happy engineers who are fulfilled by their work.
